            <p>
                It is a designers responsibility to make sure that everyone has access to what is on the website. Website
                accessibility lawsuits can be filed if a website is not accessible enough. Studies show that accessible
                websites have better search results and reach a bigger audience.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Color Contrast</h2>
            <p>
                Color contrast is an often overlooked web accessibility problem. People who have low vision could find it
                difficult to read text from a background color if it has low contrast. It is critical to consider the sufficient
                contrast between text and backgrounds. There are many ways to check the quality of the color contrast
                but for example this website https://coolors.co/contrast-checker is a good one.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Colors to differentiate Information</h2>
            <p>
                Using only color to differentiate things might make color blind people confused, it’s important to not use
                only color to make critical information understandable. People with low visual acuity or color blindness
                will have a hard time understanding your content. Try to use an indicator other than color such as text
                labels or patterns.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Alt Tags</h2>
            <p>
                Alt tags stands for Alternative tags. It reads out what is on a photo if an individual can’t see it. There are
                two ways that you can present alternative text. Within the <alt> attribute of the image element or within
                context or surroundings of the image itself.

        <h2 class="subTitle">Form Labels</h2>
            <p>
                People who use screen readers usually navigate through a form using the Tab key to jump through the
                form controls. The <label> elements are read for each form control. Any non-label text, as placeholder
                text, is usually skipped over.

    <section class="aboutCode" role="region" aria-label="Code in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle">Focus States</h2>
            <p>
                Focus indicators help people know which element has the keyboard focus and help them understand where they are when navigating your site. These are used by people who are blind and require screen readers, individuals with limited mobility, individuals who have suffered injuries like carpal tunnel, and power users who prefer this type of navigation.
