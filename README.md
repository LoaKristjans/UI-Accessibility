# Universal design approach vs. Inclusive Design
Universal design is the “one size fits all” approach. When using universal design philosophy, designers create a single solution designed to reach the most people, without the need to supplement the solution in order to accommodate for people with different needs. It works to make environments, services, and products, usable by the highest number of people.  

It is a designer’s responsibility to make sure that everyone has access to what is on the website. Inclusive design is a method or philosophy of designing that means welcoming diverse people to engage authentically with your organization, products, and services. Designing a product from scratch that meets the requirements for accessibility doesn’t add extra features or content; therefore there shouldn’t be additional cost and effort. Inclusive design focuses on exploring ways of serving a full spectrum of people who make up a diverse market. This may involve different solutions or processes for different groups of people, rather than a one size fits all approach. It will bring a better experience to everyone. Studies show that accessible websites have better search results and reach a bigger audience. 

Considering universal design, inclusive design, and accessibility is key to making products and services that are not only functional, but delightful for all.
